		<p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language
			that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
			possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to
			let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning
			that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
			without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically
			compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
			regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of
			Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than
			either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such
			as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not
			available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one
			of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
			particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9
			million developers.</p>
		<p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun
			Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released
			in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The
			original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
			machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under
			proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the
			specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most
			of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Oracle
			offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official
			reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source
			software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for
			almost all Linux distributions.</p>
		<p>As of September 2020, the latest version is Java 15, with Java
			11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released
			on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zero-cost public
			update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for
			commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with
			public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have
			begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still
			receiving security and other upgrades.</p>
		<p>Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated
			versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security
			issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14 are no longer supported,
			Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest
			version (currently Java 15) or an LTS release.</p>
